3. Reorganized Credit System to medium priority to focus on core functionality first
4. Added Social Features as a consolidated item
5. Updated story points based on new complexity understanding
6. Removed completed items (multi-language support foundation)

## Notes

1. Sprint 1 should focus on core message generation and landing page enhancement
2. Theme system implementation is critical for seasonal relevance (Holiday approaching)
3. Credit system can be implemented in parallel with user authentication
4. All features should consider the existing i18n implementation
5. Regular performance monitoring should be implemented across all features
6. Mobile responsiveness should be considered in all UI implementations

This backlog will be reviewed and updated weekly based on development progress and user feedback.
